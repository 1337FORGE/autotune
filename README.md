# AutoTune
AutoTune is a collection of my Python 3 scripts designed to automate various repetitive tasks.

## Organization
### [AutoAZ]()

The A to Z folder structure is an effective way of organizing files and folders. It simplifies the process of locating a specific folder, as users are typically only two folders away from their destination. This script will automate creating A to Z folder structure inside a folder with current year.

Usage:
```
python3 autoaz.py
```
